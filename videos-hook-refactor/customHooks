- reusable code
- created by extracting hook-related code out of a component
- always use at least one primitive hook
- should have only one purpose
- data fetching is a great use case to make reusable

#process for creating custom hooks

-identify each line of code related so tome single purpose
-indentify the inputs to that code
-identify the outputs to that code
-extract all of the code into a separate function, receiving inputs as arguments and returning the outputs
